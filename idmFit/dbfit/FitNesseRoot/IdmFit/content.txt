Acceptance tests in Identity Management Environments are somehow complex things.
Since Novell Identity Manager is based on Novell eDirectory and one of the most common connected systems is the Microsoft Active Directory, 
the number 1 common communication protocol is LDAP. This Project initialy aims to implement testing features for LDAP services. 
Therefore it implements FitNesse fixtures that uses [[!-ldapChai-!][https://code.google.com/p/ldapchai/]]

Beyond LDAP another kind of common connected systems are databases. A huge ammount auf database platforms can be addressed with JDBC 
and acceptance tests can be created with DbFit which is also part of this distribution.
